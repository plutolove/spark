/**
 * This rule has two goals:
 * <p>
 * 1. Removes {@link View} operators from the plan. The operator is respected till the end of analysis
 * stage because we want to see which part of an analyzed logical plan is generated from a view.
 * <p>
 * 2. Make sure that a view's child plan produces the view's output attributes. We try to wrap the
 * child by:
 * 1. Generate the <code>queryOutput</code> by:
 *    1.1. If the query column names are defined, map the column names to attributes in the child
 *         output by name(This is mostly for handling view queries like SELECT * FROM ..., the
 *         schema of the referenced table/view may change after the view has been created, so we
 *         have to save the output of the query to <code>viewQueryColumnNames</code>, and restore them during
 *         view resolution, in this way, we are able to get the correct view column ordering and
 *         omit the extra columns that we don't require);
 *    1.2. Else set the child output attributes to <code>queryOutput</code>.
 * 2. Map the <code>queryOutput</code> to view output by index, if the corresponding attributes don't match,
 *    try to up cast and alias the attribute in <code>queryOutput</code> to the attribute in the view output.
 * 3. Add a Project over the child, with the new output generated by the previous steps.
 * <p>
 * Once reaches this rule, it means <code>CheckAnalysis</code> did necessary checks on number of columns
 * between the view output and the child output or the query column names. <code>CheckAnalysis</code> also
 * checked the cast from the view's child to the Project is up-cast.
 * <p>
 * This should be only done after the batch of Resolution, because the view attributes are not
 * completely resolved during the batch of Resolution.
